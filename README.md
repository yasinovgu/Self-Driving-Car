# Self Driving Car
In the last couple of decades self-driving car industry is blooming. Road crash statistics are shown that around 95% are related to the error done by human. 30000 people during 2011 were killed in the European Union, and more were injured on roads [10]. Self-driving car potential to reduce accidents on road, as well as empower driver to invest time to do other activities on road. It may help to improve overall driving system more efficient and
effective, hence it will reduce fuel cost and decrease impact on environment.
The prime concern of the car manufacturers is to achieve different level autonomy. In
this paper has discussed about its different level, some research projects and examples at
those levels. Both Europe, and Americans automobile industries are actively working on
self-driving car in order to get market advantage. Though multi-agents support and id
Governments are also supporting through adapting different legislation and reconstructing
roads.
This report is consisted with nine division starts from the background history, to some
recommendation for legislation by NHTSA at the last. In between taxonomy of self-driving
cars, how it perceives the encountered driving environment and makes decision, basic
sensors that are used in common, and maps to navigate its way from starting to destination
have been discussed in each division.
